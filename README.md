Questions:
1)	What did you like about this project?
Can apply the codings that I have learnt as in how to present the website properly. 
2)	What did you struggle with in this project?
Codings are totally new to me and I find it hard to apply the codings as per the requirement, a lot of trial-an-error there.  
3)	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Have to practise more in slower pace and some guidance from tutor.
