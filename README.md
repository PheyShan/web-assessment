# Reflection
1. What did you like about this project?
Learned to develop a simple website from scratch using HTML and CSS (mainly flexbox concept) that learned recently and managed to embed a video to the website.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?
Took me throughout the day and night writing the codes and style as per the assessment requirement. 

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?
As a newbie to tech, pretty challenging to complete the entire responsive wbesite within 5 hours, longer time should be given. Managed to complete the assessment by the extended deadline from tutor.
